### Welcome to my GitHub ðŸ˜º

Hi there! I'm a graduate student specializing in NLP at Inalco, Paris. 

As a dedicated fan (? of Prof. Andrew Ng, I love learning DeepLearning.AI's specializations on Coursera (that said, it has been quite a while since I last opened their videos). ðŸ¤¡ 

Currently, I'm working on a project called Chine CoREF. Funded by the French Ministry of Higher Education and Research, this initiative will support humanities and social science research on contemporary China.
